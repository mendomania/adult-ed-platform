Django 101
======
## Diagram ##
Here is a diagram of the most important Django files for this project and how they interact with each other, with the database and with the private and public-facing set of web pages. The section below will explain in more detail what all of these files do and when you would need to make changes to them.

## Python files ##
• <b>The settings file</b> (`settings.py`)<br /><br />
This file contains all the configuration of a Django installation. It is composed of a series of variable definitions. Because it contains sensitive information, access to it should be limited. [Here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/settings/) are the official docs for this file. These are some of the variables it contains:<br /><br />
• `INSTALLED_APPS`: A list of strings designating all applications that are enabled in this Django installation. All Django packages that are needed for a project will be listed here, for instance. For this project, you can see that `django-modeltranslation`, `django-smart-selects`, `django-easy-pdf` and `django-widget-tweaks` are listed in the [settings](https://github.com/mendomania/adult-ed-platform/blob/master/app/settings.py).<br /><br />
• `DATABASES`: A Python dictionary containing the settings for all databases to be used with Django. One `default` database must be specified. Other databases could then optionally be specified too. For this project, we only define the `default` database, and that is PostgreSQL. If you wanted to use a different data store with Django, here is where you would make the change. Note that the database permissions are also specified here.<br /><br />
• `LANGUAGES`: A list of all available languages that will be used for translation purposes. Once this setting is specified, any text that is tagged as translatable in the Python code or the HTML code (read more about this in the <b>Translation</b> section down below) will be included in a message file (that will have the `po` extension, this [file](https://github.com/mendomania/adult-ed-platform/blob/master/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/django.po) is the only message file needed for this project). Translations should then be manually added to this message file, and then it should be compiled. Once that is done, Django will take care of translating web apps on the fly in each available language, according to users' language preferences. This project supports English and French.

```python
# List of languages the web app supports
LANGUAGES = (
   ('en', _('English')),
   ('fr', _('French')),
)
```     

• <b>The models file</b> (`models.py`)<br /><br />
This file specifies the fields and behaviours of the data that we want to store. Each model maps to a single database table. In that way, this file defines the <b>database schema</b> for this project. Here is one example table, `FutureMatch`.

```python
class FutureMatch(models.Model):
   class Meta:
      verbose_name = _('future match')
      verbose_name_plural = _('future matches')  
      ordering = ['order_id']

   def __str__(self):
      return self.code 
    
   goal = models.ForeignKey(GoalPath, on_delete=models.CASCADE, verbose_name=_('goal path'))
   code = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name=_('code'))
   text = models.CharField(max_length=500, verbose_name=_('text'))
   order_id = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField(verbose_name=_('order id'), default=1, \
      help_text=_('a lower order id will show up first, min value is 1'))    
```

This code snippet was taken from the [models](https://github.com/mendomania/adult-ed-platform/blob/master/osr/models.py) file of this project. It defines a database table called `FutureMatch` with a foreign key (`goal`) to another table called `GoalPath`, two char fields (`code` and `text`), and a positive small integer field (`order_id`). Note how all strings in this class as tagged as translatable. Please refer to the <b>Translation</b> section below for more details on this.<br /><br /> 
The variables `verbose_name` and `help_text` refer to the strings that will be shown in the admin interface next to their corresponding  fields whenever a user performs any CRUD operation (create, read, update, delete) on the `FutureMatch` table through the admin interface (that is shown in the diagram as the window with the <b>Private</b> label under it). Please refer to the description of the admin file below for more details on this.<br /><br />
[Here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/db/models/) are the official docs for models in Django.<br />

• <b>The admin file</b> (`admin.py`)<br /><br />
Once the models file is created and the `migrate` and `makemigrations` commands are run (more on this below), Django will automatically provide an admin interface that works out-of-the-box and allows authenticated users to perform CRUD operations on database tables (note that groups and permissions can be created such that some users have access and CRUD permissions on only certain tables, more on this [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/auth/)).<br /><br />
The admin file can then be used to define `ModelAdmin` classes. These are representations of a model in the admin interface. In a nutshell, this file is used to customise the admin interface. For example, by deciding which fields of each model should even show up in this interface (perhaps there are fields that we don't want to show to users), to group together certain fields in a section with a specific label (so it's easier for users to go through the process of adding a new record in a certain table) or to make sure a certain user or group of users can only see the records they have created.

```python
class FutureMatchAdmin(TranslationAdmin):
   pass
admin.site.register(FutureMatch, FutureMatchAdmin)  
```

This code snippet was taken from the [admin](https://github.com/mendomania/adult-ed-platform/blob/master/osr/admin.py) file of this project. Here you can see that for the `FutureMatch` table no special processing is done in the admin file, other than defining a subclass of the base class `TranslationAdmin` (which is part of the <b>django-modeltranslation</b> package) that is called `FutureMatchAdmin` and then registering `FutureMatch` to this `ModelAdmin` class.
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/mendomania/adult-ed-platform/blob/master/example_admin.png" align="center">
</p>

Here is a screenshot of how this looks in the admin interface. Note how the four `FutureMatch` fields defined in the models section above show up in the admin interface with the `verbose_name` and `help_text` values that were defined. Also note how the char field `Text` appears twice, in English and in French. This is because it was tagged as a translatable field. Please refer to the <b>Translation</b> section below for more details on this.<br /><br />
[Here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/contrib/admin/) are the official docs for the Django admin interface.<br />

• <b>The views file</b> (`views.py`)<br /><br />
A view is a Python function that takes a web request and returns a web response. For this project, there is a view definition for each of the public-facing webpages as well as two special ones that correspond to the print and e-mail functionalities. 

```python
def comparison(request):
""" 
This view corresponds to the comparison page.
This page will present the user with a carousel showing programs to be compared.
"""

# Show all programs by default
programs = Program.objects.all()

# If some programs are passed as parameters then show only those programs
pro_filter = request.GET.getlist('p')
if pro_filter and pro_filter[0]:
   query = Q()
   for val in pro_filter:
      query = query | Q(code=val)
   programs = programs.filter(query)  

return render(request, 'osr/comparison.html', {'programs': programs})
```

This code snippet corresponds to the view that controls the [comparison](https://github.com/mendomania/adult-ed-platform/blob/master/osr/templates/osr/comparison.html) page. As you can see, it queries the database, does some very basic filtering, and then combines the comparison page template with a variable called `programs` and returns an HttpResponse object. The comparison page template will then use that `programs` object to display program information to the user.<br /><br />
Most of the code in the views file either queries the PostgreSQL database or performs some processing with the data before attaching it to an HTML template an returning an HttpResponse object. And so, while the code is in Python, it does not make use of any advanced libraries; it merely consists of manipulating basic data structures.<br /><br />
[Here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/http/views/) are the official docs for views in Django.<br />

• <b>The URL dispatcher</b> (`urls.py`)<br /><br />
This file maps URL path expressions to Django views (which in turn map to HTML templates, as explained in the preceding section). Regular expressions are used to define URL path expressions. For instance, the example below (taken from the URL [dispatcher](https://github.com/mendomania/adult-ed-platform/blob/master/osr/urls.py) of this project) shows that the URL path `comparison` maps to the `comparison` view definition (as shown in the previous section) and that the URL path `program` followed by a `program_code` made up of at least one lowercase letter maps to the `detail_program` view.

```python
# Comparison page
url(r'comparison/$', views.comparison, name='comparison'),
     
# Dynamic program pages
# ex: /program/lbs/
url(r'program/(?P<program_code>[a-z]+)/$', views.detail_program, name='detail_program'),     
```

[Here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/http/urls/) are the official docs for the URL dispatcher in Django.<br />

• <b>The DB translation file</b> (`translation.py`)<br /><br />
This file is required by the <b>django-modeltranslation</b> package and allows to tag fields of tables as translatable. Once a certain field is tagged as translatable and the `migrate` and `makemigrations` commands are run (more on this below), Django will update a table schema and add extra fields to it corresponding to the languages of the web app (which are defined in the settings file, as explained above). 

```python
@register(FutureMatch)
class FutureMatchTranslationOptions(TranslationOptions):
   fields = ('text',)
```

For instance, the previous code snippet (taken from the [translation](https://github.com/mendomania/adult-ed-platform/blob/master/osr/translation.py) file of this project) specifies that the field `text` of the `FutureMatch` table should be translatable. Django will add columns `text_en` and `text_fr` to the `FutureMatch` table (this is why in the admin interface screenshot shown above it appears twice, in English and in French). The original column `text` will be retained though. You don't never have to worry about having to access either `text_en` or `text_fr` though; you only need to access the original fields defined in the models file, and in the case of a translatable field, Django will make sure to provide you with either the English or the French version of it by taking a look at a user's current language preferences.       

## Translation ##
As mentioned previously, this project is setup to work in English and in French.<br /> 
It requires three types of translations:<br /><br />
• <b>Database content (or dynamic text)</b><br /><br />
A lot of the data that users see when they visit the different pages of this web app comes straight from the database. As such, by means of the <b>django-modeltranslation</b> package, this data is stored in the DB in both English and French. Django will look at the user's current language preferences to make the decision as to the language the data should be presented in (as explained in the previous section).<br />
If you need to create or update a table and you want some of its fields to be translatable, follow five three steps:<br />
1. Define the model in `models.py`
2. Run the `migrate` and `makemigrations` commands (Django will then create the table in PostgreSQL; more on this in the <b>Useful commands</b> section)
3. Tag the fields you want to be translatable as such in `translation.py`
4. Run the `migrate` and `makemigrations` commands again (Django will then update the table to add the new columns, suffixes indicate the language)
5. Register the model as a subclass of `TranslationAdmin` (just like for `FutureMatch` and `FutureMatchAdmin` above)
<br />

• <b>Static text in web app</b><br /><br />
The rest of the text users see when they visit the different webpages corresponds to either static text in the HTML pages (template code) or strings that come straight from the Python code. These strings need to be first be tagged as translatable, then translated, and finally their translations must be compiled. [Here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/i18n/translation/) are the official Django docs that describe this process in detail.<br />

We want to translate strings in a lazy fashion (that is, translate strings every time we access the name of an attribute on a model). This is because a user might be looking at the model in different languages since Django started.<br /><br />
1.A For HTML pages, static text is tagged as translatable with `{% blocktrans %}` template tags. <br />
The code snippet below links to the feedback page and it is included in all webpages of the project.

```html
<!-- Feedback -->
<div class="minty columns small-12 text-center">
   {% blocktrans %}This page will be improved using your feedback{% endblocktrans %}. 
   <a href="{% url 'osr:feedback' %}" target="_blank">
      {% blocktrans %}Please tell us what you think{% endblocktrans %}.
   </a>
</div>
```
1.B For Python code, a string is tagged as translatable by calling `ugettext_lazy`. <br />
The code snippet below is taken from the [views](https://github.com/mendomania/adult-ed-platform/blob/master/osr/views.py) file.
```python
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _

send_mail(
   subject = _('Your results and recommendations'),
   message = "",
   html_message = html_message,
   from_email = 'noreply@codefor.ca',
   recipient_list = [email_address],
) 
```
2. Once all static strings have been tagged for translation, the message file for French translations (`django.po`) needs to be updated with the new translatable strings.<br /> 
This is done by running this command from the root directory of the Django project.<br />

```
    $ django-admin makemessages -l fr
```

3. Translations can then be manually added to the `django.po` file.<br /> 
It'll look like in the following example.<br />
```python
#: osr/forms.py:157
msgid "Please correct the errors in this form and submit it again"
msgstr "Veuillez corregir les erreurs dans le formulaire et le resoumettre"
```

4. Each time we make changes to the `django.po` message file it needs to be recompiled to create a binary file (`django.mo`) that will be optimized to provide translations.<br /> 
This is done by running this command from the root directory of the Django project.<br />

```
    $ django-admin compilemessages
```

• <b>Static text in matchmaker</b><br /><br />
The content of the matchmaker is independent of the web app and translations have to be added directly into the JSON [file](https://github.com/mendomania/adult-ed-platform/blob/master/osr/static/osr/flow.json) that powers it.<br />

## E-mail ##
SendGrid was used as the e-mail service for this development phase. I followed this [tutorial](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Integrate/Frameworks/django.html) to set it up. I didn't push its corresponding setting values in the [settings](https://github.com/mendomania/adult-ed-platform/blob/master/app/settings.py) file here on GitHub because my SendGrid account is a trial one, and it allows to send only 100 e-mails a day. Make sure you follow the official [docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/email/) on sending e-mail in Django if you want to use a different e-mail service.
